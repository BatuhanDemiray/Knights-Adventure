# Knight's Adventure

Knight's Adventure is 2D side-scroller platformer game made with Unity for PC 

This game is a project I made to learn a new technology and improve myself during my IT internship in 2021. In this first serious game I designed using the Unity game engine, Sprite Sheets are taken from open source sources from the internet, but there is no problem for personal use.

## Language Screen

<img src=img/language.png width=600 height=600><br>
There are 2 language options in the game, one of them is Turkish and the other is English. The language is changed instantly when the buttons are clicked. The system I use for this localization process is [Lean Localization](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/localization/lean-localization-28504).

<a id="hud"></a>
# HUD

There are 3 elements on the screen as the HUD Screen. These are Pause Button, Health Bar and Coin Canvas.


<a id="paused-screen"></a>
## Paused Screen

<img src=img/paused.png><br>
Resume, Restart and Exit operations can be performed in this menu that opens when the Pause Button is clicked.
```C#
 public void RestartGame(){
      Scene scene = SceneManager.GetActiveScene();
      SceneManager.LoadScene(scene.name);
      Time.timeScale = 1.0f;
 }

public void PauseGame(){
    isGamePaused = !isGamePaused;

    if (isGamePaused == true){
        Time.timeScale = 0.0f;
        pauseGame.SetActive(true);
    }
    else{
        Time.timeScale = 1.0f;
        pauseGame.SetActive(false);
    }     
}

public void ExitGame(){
    SceneManager.LoadScene("Scenes/OpeningScene");
    Time.timeScale = 1.0f;
}

```

<a id="health-bar"></a>
## Health Bar

<img src=img/health-bar.png><br>
The area where the health status of our character is displayed on the screen.

```C#
  void UpdateUI(){
      healthBar.value = player.currentPlayerHealth;
      if (player.currentPlayerHealth <= 0)
          healthBar.minValue = 0;
  }

```


<a id="coin-canvas"></a>
## Coin Canvas

<img src=img/coin-canvas.png><br>
The area where the amount of coin collected by our character is displayed on the screen.


<a id="collectibles"></a>
# Collectibles

There are 2 collectible objects in the game. These are coin and health potions.


<a id="coin"></a>
## Coin

<img src=img/coin.png><br>
The coin found at different points in the game, instead of appearing on the screen in a fixed way, has a more pleasant appearance by making a rotation animation around itself.


<a id="health-potion"></a>
## Health Potion

<img src=img/health-potion.png><br>
This object, which helps to increase the health of our character, can be found in various parts of the game.

```C#
  void BoostHealth(){
      if (addHealth)
      {
          currentPlayerHealth += giveHealth.health;
          addHealth = false;
          audioSource.PlayOneShot(audioHealth);
      }
  }

```
    

<a id="camera"></a>
## Camera Follow System

I used a package called [Cinemachine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cinemachine@2.1/manual/index.html) for our character to be followed by the camera.
